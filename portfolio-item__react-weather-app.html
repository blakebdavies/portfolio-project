            <p>This is a <span class="highlight">React</span> project focused on creating a simple, user-friendly design
                with real-time weather
                search functionality. This was my first React project and I learned so much by building each component.
                My
                end goal of this project was to
                create a fully functional worldwide weather checker that allows users to search a city and see the
                weather
                in real-time as
                well as the 5-day forecast. I also wanted to build on my skillset by creating a temperature conversion
                that will change
                the forecasted temperature to either ºC or ºF in order to be more accessible for international users.
            </p>
            <p>
                I divided this project in two phases. The first phase was creating the weather search by integrating the
                <span class="highlight">OpenWeatherMap
                    API</span> and returning the real-time, current weather of a chosen city, displaying both imperial
                and metric
                temperatures as
                well as the weather description, humidity, and wind speed.The main challenge of this phase was deciding
                when to create
                different components as to not over complicate their functionality.
            </p>

            <p> The second phase was dedicated to creating the daily forecast by building the layout, styling the
                feature, and
                integrating the API with the interface to display the data on the app, making sure it looks good for
                different
                scenarios. In this phase, I learned to loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript <strong>map()
                    function</strong> to take care
                of rendering the daily forecast for the consecutive dates in order to avoid repetitive code. I also
                learned the
                importance of ensuring that a function must return something at all times, even if it is null. The main
                challenge of
                building the forecast feature was to ensure that the weather data displayed each day would update when
                the weather data
                of the parent component changed due to coordinates of a new city search. To accomplish this, I learned
                to incorporate a
                <strong>{ Use Effect }</strong> which allows you to run code after the component is changed and loaded.
            </p>

            <p> I also decided to build a feature that would display the current day and time of the city that you
                search. This was
                important to me because I find it helpful feature for those traveling to new destinations or for those
                with
                friends/family in other parts of the world.</p>

            <p>I am very pleased with the end result of the application, however I would improve it further by choosing
                a
                more
                sophisticated API that would display the weather of every city and country. I found the OpenWeatherMap
                API
                easy to use,
                but it was limited in its results without inputting exact coordinates. For example, if searching for
                "Rome",
                the API
                does not take into account multiple cities in the world named "Rome" and returns "Rome, USA" rather than
                "Rome, Italy" -
                which is why I decided to display the country name as well as the city name in the application.
