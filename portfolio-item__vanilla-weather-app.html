            <p>Using <span class="highlight">Vanilla Javascript</span>, I built this weather app fully-functioning
                weather app, gaining skills in
                Bootstrap, API’s,
                real-life development workflow, hosting, and advanced JavaScript. My end goal of this project was to
                create
                a fully
                functional worldwide weather checker that allows users to search a city and see the weather in real-time
                as well as the
                upcoming 5-day forecast.</p>

            <p>I divided this project in two phases. The first phase was creating the weather search by integrating the
                API and returning the real-time, current weather of a chosen city, displaying the weather description,
                humidity, and
                wind speed. The main challenge of this phase was deconstructing the application into functions and
                understanding the
                possibilities of my chosen API, <span class="highlight">OpenWeatherMap.</span></p>

            <p>The second phase was dedicated to creating the 5-day forecast by building the layout, styling the
                feature, and
                using a more complex API integration to include the data of the 5-day forecast. The first
                challenge of this
                section was deciding where to call the One Call API because this could only be done once the
                coordinates of
                the city were established, so I had to find the right place to get the forecast results, only after the
                first API call.
                The second challenge was building the string to inject within the html for each day of the forecast
                prediction. In order
                to do this, I had to concatenate a larger string and then add each day, one at a time for the forecast.
            </p>

            <p>I am happy with the appearance and functionaly of the application, however I would improve it by adding
                in a temperature
                conversion, so that the user can choose whether they'd like to see the weather in ºC or ºF.
